# What If...

What If... is, primarily, a game consisting of a series of linear quizzes. Each quiz
consists of set of tokens and a series of yes or no questions that affect each token
by adding or subtracting a numerical value to them. What If... is also a coding 
exercise using Python, Django and MongoDB. The coding exercise consisted of building
a CMS/Administration to add games, tokens, and questions.

## Python Dependencies

What If... is built using Django with a MongoDB backend. Thus, in order to run the 
application in either a local or remote environment, you'll need the following Python
libraries:

- [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [pymongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/)
- [mongoengine](http://mongoengine.org/)

## MongoDB

Additionally, you'll need a running instance of MongoDB for the application to work. 
The application in this git repository is configured to connect to an instance of 
MongoDB on the local computer/server.
