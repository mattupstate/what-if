# What If...

What If... is, primarily, a game consisting of a series of linear quizzes. Each quiz
consists of set of tokens and a series of yes or no questions that affect each token
by adding or subtracting a numerical value to them. What If... is also a coding 
exercise using Python, Django and MongoDB. The coding exercise consisted of building
a CMS/Administration to add games, tokens, and questions.

## Dependencies

What If... is built using Django with a MongoDB backend. Thus, in order to run the 
application in either a local or remote environment, you'll need the following Python
libraries:

- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
- [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [pymongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/)
- [mongoengine](http://mongoengine.org/)

You'll want to install these into your environment using 
[easy_install](http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html) or  
[pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/). I personally prefer pip.
